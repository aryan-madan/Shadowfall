# Shadowfall

Welcome to Shadowfall, a narrative-driven virtual desktop environment where you step into the shoes of an FBI agent caught in a web of cyber-conspiracy. The game combines a realistic desktop simulation with top-down RPG exploration, creating a unique and immersive experience.

## Key Features

*   **Dual Desktop Environments:** Switch between your personal desktop and a secure, retro-futuristic FBI virtual OS.
*   **Interactive Storyline:** Engage with a mysterious hacker named "Void" through a secure messenger, make choices that impact your system's integrity, and uncover a deep-seated conspiracy.
*   **Simulated Applications:** Analyze case files, view evidence, and manage your system through a suite of custom applications.
*   **RPG Exploration:** Step away from the computer to explore physical locations, find clues, and advance the story.
*   **Atmospheric Design:** Features a distinct "hacker" aesthetic with scanlines, glitch effects, and a dynamic soundtrack that responds to the game's state.

## AI-Assisted Development

This project was developed with the assistance of an AI partner, which was responsible for approximately 20% of the codebase. The AI's role was primarily focused on accelerating development by handling specific, well-defined tasks.

AI was instrumental in:
*   **Debugging:** Quickly identifying and fixing bugs, such as type mismatches and logical errors found in component props.
*   **Repetitive Tasks & Boilerplate:** Generating boilerplate code for hooks like character movement, including physics constants for friction and acceleration. It also helped scaffold data structures, such as defining application constants and location data.
*   **Rapid Prototyping:** Assisting in the initial creation of components and functions.

The core creative and architectural work—including the narrative design, core game logic, UI/UX, and overall application structure—was led by human developers. The AI served as a powerful tool for streamlining the development process, allowing us to focus more on the creative aspects that make Shadowfall a unique experience.
