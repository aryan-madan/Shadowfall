i really hadnt participated in game jams before and neither had my teammates. we came into daydream as an opportunity to create something of ourselves. i had prior experience with a react-based tech stack so i chos that for the game.

for the topic, we had decided to make a desktop emulator, rpg cryptic game. that sounds like a mouthful ik.
me (aryan) and nikunj had participated in alot of crypts and were fascinated by them
so, here's shadowfall, a narrative driven virtual desktop rpg game, where you step into the shoes of a woman, who got a laptop owned by an fbi agent and you're caught in a conspiracy.

key features:
sacrifice feature, sacrifice your integrity or your files, what is more important to you?
it has an interactive storyline with a hacker called void.
analyse files, decrypt evidence and find clues to solve void.

ai assistance:
debugging, repetitive tasks and boilerplates for components, bug fixing, the rest was done manually.

the ai basically helped streamlining the process.
the assets were not at all ai, and were fully human made as we spent a lot of time on the environments.

some code is still left from what we planned due to a shortage of time :(

ASSETS:
https://limezu.itch.io/moderninteriors
https://sscary.itch.io/the-adventurer-female
https://trevor-pupkin.itch.io/tech-dungeon-roguelite

Sounds from youtube
Maps were made ourselves without AI

do 6+7 on the calculator !!!!
