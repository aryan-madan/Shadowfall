i really hadnt participated in game jams before and neither had my teammates. we came into daydream as an opportunity to create something of ourselves. i had prior experience with a react-based tech stack so i chos that for the game.

for the topic, we had decided to make a desktop emulator, rpg cryptic game. that sounds like a mouthful ik.
me (aryan) and nikunj had participated in alot of crypts and were fascinated by them
so, here's shadowfall, a narrative driven virtual desktop rpg game, where you step into the shoes of a woman, who got a laptop owned by an fbi agent and you're caught in a conspiracy.

key features:
sacrifice feature, sacrifice your integrity or your files, what is more important to you?
it has an interactive storyline with a hacker called void.
analyse files, decrypt evidence and find clues to solve void.

ai assistance:
debugging, repetitive tasks and boilerplates for components, bug fixing, the rest was done manually.

the ai basically helped streamlining the process.
the assets were not at all ai, and were fully human made as we spent a lot of time on the environments.

some code is still left from what we planned due to a shortage of time :(

Welcome to Shadowfall, a narrative-driven virtual desktop environment where you step into the shoes of an FBI agent caught in a web of cyber-conspiracy. The game combines a realistic desktop simulation with top-down RPG exploration, creating a unique and immersive experience.
